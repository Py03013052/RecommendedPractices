    "**Archimedes of Syracuse** (287-212 BCE) derived upper and lower bounds on the value of $π$ by using a high-degree polygon to approximate a circular shape. Using a polygon with 96 sides, he concluded that $223/71 < π < 22/7$. Giving upper and lower bounds was a rather sophisticated approach for the time. Also, if we take his best estimate as the average of his two bounds we obtain $3.1418$, an error of about $0.0002$. **Not bad!**\n",

The ratio of the number of needles with tips lying within the square to the number of needles with tips lying within the circle could then be used to estimate the area of the circle.\n",

    "As the 20th century progressed, the limitations of this approach became increasingly clear. Reasons for this include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An increased interest in the social sciences, e.g., economics, led to a desire to construct good models of systems that were not mathematically tractable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As the systems to be modeled grew increasingly complex, it seemed easier to successively refine a series of simulation models than to construct accurate analytic models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is often easier to extract useful intermediate results from a simulation than from an analytical model, e.g., to play “what if” games.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The availability of computers made it feasible to run large-scale simulations. Until the advent of the modern computer in the middle of the 20th century the utility of simulation was limited by the time required to perform calculations by hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation models are **descriptive**, not **prescriptive**. They tell how a system works under given conditions; not how to arrange the conditions to make the system work best. A simulation does not optimize, it merely describes. That is not to say that simulation cannot be used as part of an optimization process. For example, simulation is often used as part of a search process in finding an optimal set of parameter settings.\n",
