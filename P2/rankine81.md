Steam is the working fluid in an ideal Rankine cycle. 

* Saturated vapor enters the turbine at 8.0 MPa 
   
* Saturated liquid exits the condenser at a pressure of 0.008 MPa.

**Engineering Model:**

1. Each component of the cycle is analyzed as a control volume at steady state. The control volumes are shown on the accompanying sketch by dashed lines.
2.  All processes of the working fluid are internally reversible.
3.  The turbine and pump operate adiabatically.
4.  Kinetic and potential energy effects are negligible.
5.  Saturated vapor enters the turbine. Condensate exits the condenser as saturated liquid.
