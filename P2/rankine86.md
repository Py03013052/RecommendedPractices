Example 8.6 : Considering a Reheat–Regenerative Cycle with Two Feedwater Heaters, a closed feedwater heater and an
open feedwater heater. 

* Steam enters the first turbine at 8.0 MPa, 480°C and expands to 0.7 MPa. 

* The steam is reheated to 440°C before entering the second turbine, where it expands to the condenser pressure of 0.008 MPa.

* Steam is extracted from the first turbine at 2 MPa and fed to the closed feedwater heater. 

* Feedwater leaves the closed heater at 205°C and 8.0 MPa, and condensate exits as saturated liquid at 2 MPa. 

* The condensate is trapped into the open feedwater heater. 

* Steam extracted from the second turbine at 0.3 MPa is also fed into the open feedwater heater, which operates at 0.3 MPa. The stream exiting the open feedwater heater is saturated liquid at 0.3 MPa. 
 
* There is no stray heat transfer from any component to its surroundings. 

* If the working fluid experiences no irreversibilities as it passes through the turbines, pumps, steam generator, reheater, and condenser,

**Engineering Model:**

1. Each component in the cycle is analyzed as a control volume at steady state. The control volumes are
shown on the accompanying sketch by dashed lines.

2. There is no stray heat transfer from any component to its surroundings.

3. The working fluid undergoes internally reversible processes as it passes through the turbines, pumps,
steam generator, reheater, and condenser.

4. The expansion through the trap is a throttling process.

5. Kinetic and potential energy effects are negligible.

6. Condensate exits the closed heater as a saturated liquid at 2 MPa. Feedwater exits the open heater as a saturated liquid at 0.3 MPa. Condensate exits the condenser as a saturated liquid.
